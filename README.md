# Machine Learning Models Showcase

A collection of classic Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Python, including:

| File | Algorithm |
|------|-----------|
| `DecisionTree.py` | Decision Tree Classifier |
| `RandomForest.py` | Random Forest Classifier |
| `SVM.py` | Support Vector Machine |
| `KKN.py` | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) |

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python (3.x) is installed.
2. Install dependencies (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas)â€”if any using:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas
   ````

*(Adjust based on your actual imports.)*
3. Run a script from terminal:

   ```bash
   python DecisionTree.py
   ```

*(Similarly for other models.)*

## Output

Results will be printed to the console or saved to output files (e.g., `output_with_phases_all_sheets.xlsx`).
